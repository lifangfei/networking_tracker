        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>1. Think about your networking goals and create groups of people you need to reach out to. Separate them out by industry, business function, relationships, etc. Whatever you think best suits your needs.</p>
          <p>2. Record people that you reach out to in each list to the best of your ability. These people will make up your 'connections' list</p>
          <p>3. Every time you have a conversation over email, phone, coffee, etc. jot down that information as an 'interaction'</p>
          <p>4. Don't let your networks die. Set dates for follow-up interactions to reach out to your existing network</p>

          <p>"Networking is an essential part of building wealth" - Armstrong Williams</p>
          <p>Networking is all about connecting with people. But then again, isn't that what life is about? The more time you can find to get out of the office and build true friendships, the farther your startup will go" - Jay Samit</p>
          <p>"To be successful, you have to be able to relate to people; they have to be satisfied with your personality to be able to do business with you and to build a relationship with mutual trust" - George Ross</p>
          <p>"Pulling a good network together takes effort, sincerity and time" - Alan Collins</p>
          <p>"You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you" - Dale Carnegie</p>
          <p>"The currency of real networking is not greed but generosity" - Keith Ferrazzi</p>
